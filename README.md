Data and code for the paper "Using Dynamic and Static Techniques to Establish Traceability Links Between Production Code and Test Code on Python Projects: A Replication Study"

[Data](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data): including the [Prediction result](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/Prediction%20Result), [Groundtruth](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/Groundtruth) and [FP&FN Inspection](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/FP%26FN%20Inspection).

  - [Prediction result](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/Prediction%20Result) contains the prediction result of RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3. It has 11 fields: level, type, tech, precision, recall, f1, mAP, auc, tp, fp and fn.
  - [Groundtruth](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/Groundtruth) contains the ground truth used in our experiments. The ground truth went through two rounds of review, which included module-level and method-level results. The module-level contains two fields: 'test root' and 'production root'. And the method-level contains four fields: 'test root', 'test method name', 'production root' and 'production method name'.
  - [FP&FN Inspection](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/FP%26FN%20Inspection) contains the samples of FN and FP. Which divided into module-level and method-level. We divided these samples into 8 categories and describe them in [Category.xlsx](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/blob/main/data/FP%26FN%20Inspection/Category.xlsx). Module-level samples have 3 fields: 'test module', 'production module' and 'type'. Method-level samples have 5 fields: 'test root', 'test method name', 'production root', 'production method name' and 'type'.

Data and code for the paper "Using Dynamic and Static Techniques to Establish Traceability Links Between Production Code and Test Code on Python Projects: A Replication Study"

[Data](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data): including the [Prediction result](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/Prediction%20Result), [Groundtruth](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/Groundtruth), [FP&FN Inspection](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/FP%26FN%20Inspection), and [Call Info](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/Call%20Info).
  - [Prediction result](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/Prediction%20Result) contains the prediction result of RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3. It has 8 fields: level, type, tech, precision, recall, f1, mAP, auc.
  - [Groundtruth](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/Groundtruth) contains the ground truth used in our experiments. The ground truth went through two rounds of review, which includes module-level and method-level results. The module-level contains two fields: 'test root' and 'production root'. And the method-level contains four fields: 'test root', 'test method name', 'production root' and 'production method name'.
  - [FP&FN Inspection](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/FP%26FN%20Inspection) contains the samples of FN and FP including module-level and method-level. We divide these samples into 8 categories and describe them in [Category.xlsx](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/blob/main/data/FP%26FN%20Inspection/Category.xlsx). Module-level samples have 3 fields: 'test module', 'production module', and 'type'. Method-level samples have 5 fields: 'test root', 'test method name', 'production root', 'production method name', and 'type'.
  - [Call Info](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/data/Call%20Info) contains the call information required by the judges, including call depth, call frequency, call type and other information.


[Code](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/code): including the source code for all the experiments.
  - [method_main.py](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/code/method_main.py) and [file_main.py](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/code/file_main.py) compute the scores of all linking techniques for Python projects at the method level and the file level, respectively.
  - [prediction_method.py](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/code/prediction_method.py) and [prediction_file.py](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/code/prediction_file.py) predict test-to-code links using each linking technique for Python projects at the method level and the file level, respectively.
  - [prediction_cross_level.py](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/code/prediction_cross_level.py) predicts test-to-code links after augumenting cross-level information for Python projects at both levels.
  - [prediction_combination.py](https://github.com/233Steven/Using-Dynamic-and-Static-Techniques-to-Establish-Traceability-Links-Between-Production-Code-and-Test/tree/main/code/prediction_combination.py) predicts test-to-code links using different combination strategies for Python projects at both levels.
